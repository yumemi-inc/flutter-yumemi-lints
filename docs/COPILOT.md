You should be aware of what information those tools collect from your project and use for learning.

## Risks of GitHub Copilot
GitHub Copilot can be used by setting up a subscription.
There are two types of subscriptions: personal and organizational (Organization or Enterprise) as shown below. Note that each has a different privacy policy.
- [GitHub Copilot Individual](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/overview-of-github-copilot/about-github-copilot-individual)
- [GitHub Copilot Business](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/overview-of-github-copilot/about-github-copilot-business)

### Risk as an IDE extension
Note that the extent to which GitHub Copilot extensions are enabled depends on the IDE.
VSCode and Xcode allow you to enable it on a per-project basis, but other IDEs do not allow you to control it on a per-project basis, so you must be careful not to accidentally run Copilot.
